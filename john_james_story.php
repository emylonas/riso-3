<h4>Story, John James (1827-1900)</h4>

                    <p> A local artist from Nottingham in the northern midlands of England, Story
                        was born in 1827 and baptized at St. Mary’s Church, Nottingham, on 23rd
                        December of that year. His father, George, was a “cordwainer” (shoemaker).
                        Little is known about his early career but he is mentioned in the local
                        census as living in Burton Street in 1861 with his parents and sisters; he
                        is described as a widower aged 32 with his profession listed as “artist.”
                        This is the period when the Garibaldi Panorama was being exhibited and the
                        information matches the notation in the front of the manuscript narration:
                        “J.J.Story, Burton Street, Nottingham, 7th Sep. 1860.” </p>
                    <p> Ten years later, he is remarried, to Jane, and living with his parents in
                        Great Alfred Street, Nottingham. In the next census of 1881, he and Jane
                        along with their daughter Emily Jackson, are living at 367 St. Ann’s Well
                        Road, and his profession is listed as a “photographic artist.” In 1891, he
                        is at the same address but Emily is listed as his niece, and his profession
                        as a “landscape artist.” </p>
                    <p> In terms of his artistic career, he exhibited occasionally at the “open”
                        exhibitions in the Nottingham castle annual show. There are entries for
                        1881, 1885, 1886, 1892 and 1893 (see below); he is listed in the latter year
                        as living at Thorneywood Cottages, 367 St. Ann’s Well Road. He also
                        exhibited in 1895 when his address was 36, Moffat Street, Nottingham (still
                        in the St. Ann’s area). It appears that two relatives, Blanche and Mary
                        Story, also exhibited. </p>
