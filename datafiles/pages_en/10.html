         <del>Long before you come to the coast of
                    <br>
            <span class="place">Melazzo</span>, you see an isolated rock resembling
                    <br>somewhat that of <span class="place">Gibralter</span>. On it stands
                    <br>the citadel of <span class="place">Melazzo</span> occupying an area of
                    <br>half a square mile and falling off baldly on
                    <br>all sides. At the foot of it, towards the
                    <br>land side, lies the town. <span class="sic-corr">b</span>oth are con­
                    <br>nected by a narrow strip of land with the

                    <br>forms one of the most commodious
                    <br>harbours in <span class="place">Sicily</span>. This ground was the
                    <br>theatre of the Battle of <span class="place">Malazzo</span>. The fight
                    <br>lasted for  hours, in the heat of the
                    <br>day. The Neapolitans mainly stood on the
                    <br>defensive firing from behind <span class="gap">[gap of 1chars]</span>

         <del>In order to dislodge the enemy, the company
                    <br>of Genoese Rifles were sent into the thicket.
                    <br>The canes were so close that it was only
                    <br>with difficulty the men could pass.
