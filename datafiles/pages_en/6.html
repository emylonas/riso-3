                    <br>St Peters (shown in the view before us) is the largest
                    <br>and most magnificent Ec<span class="sic-corr"/>lesiastical structure in

                    <br>of fifteen miles, but the greater part of the space

                    <br>far from being a fine city. The streets are generally
                    <br>narrow and the houses crowded together, and the dirt
                    <br>and filth which every where abound is a disgrace to
                    <br>a civilized country, and is what few would expect

                    <br>The balls made the house shake as if by an earthquake; and frequently, to afford this
