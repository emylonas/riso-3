         <del>A general cry arose to charge,—At last there
                    <br>seemed a chance to get at the enemy, but as <del>usual</del>
                    <br>usual he did not wait for the bayonet, and a
                    <br>few well aimed shots was all the satisfaction
                    <br>which the Genoese got.</del> On the road towards
                    <br>the town the Neapolitans made a last effort
                    <br>to hold out concealing themselves behind some
                    <br>large boats drawn up on the beach, and helped
                    <br>by their field artillery, as well as that from the
                    <br>castle. This checked the Garibaldians for a time.
                    <br>But a column passing through a garden to the
                    <br>left and the arrival of a steam frig<span class="sic-corr">g</span>ate
                    <br>soon changed their resolution. <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> who
                    <br>saw her approaching got into a boat and went
                    <br>on board where his presence animated all.
                    <br>A few well aimed shots from the frig<span class="sic-corr">g</span>ate
                    <br>and the voll<span class="sic-corr">ie</span>s from the advancing c<span class="sic-corr">all</span>umn
                    <br>followed up with a bayonet attack broke
                    <br>this last resist<span class="sic-corr">e</span>nce of the Neapolitans.
                    <br>Routed and dismayed they fled in confusion
                    <br>towards the town, leaving fifty guns <del>in the
                    <br>hands of the victors</del> 139 horses and one
                    <br>hundred thousand rounds of ammunition as the

      </h5>
                    <p>During the Battle of <span class="place">Melazzo</span>, one advance
                    <br>bolder than the rest brought them to the guns
                    <br>
         <del>An English</del> sailor was the first across the wall
                    <br>behind which the guns were posted, and the
                    <br>next mom<span class="sic-corr">o</span>nt they were carried in triumph.
                    <br>Just at that instant a cry arose of
                    <br>
         <span class="quoted">Cavalry!—Cavalry!</span> and excited con­
                    <br>fusion—vain were the attempts of
                    <br>
         <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> and his officers to overcome
                    <br>this bugbear of young troops, they
                    <br>pressed against a garden wall on one
                    <br>side, and jumping a ditch on the other,
                    <br>they opened a road to about a dozen bold
                    <br>horsemen who with their captain at
                    <br>their head rushed through this break in
                    <br>our line to recapture the guns.—<span class="person">Garibaldi</span>
                    <br>had only time to pass aside when the
                    <br>horsemen passed sabreing right and left.
                    <br>But they did not go far, for after the
                    <br>first panic, the infantry recovered and
                    <br>soon emptied the greater part of their
                    <br>saddles.</p>

                    <p>The Captain, a Sergeant, and a private tried to
                    <br>make their escape, and would have succeeded
                    <br>but for <span class="person">Garibaldi's</span> personal bravery, he went
                    <br>into the middle of the road, having left his
                    <br>revolvers in the holsters when he dismounted.
                    <br>—he drew his sword and placed himself in
                    <br>a position to stop the captain, the only
                    <br>person with him at the time was <span class="person">Captain Missori</span>
                    <br>who was also on foot, but armed with a <em class="underline">revolver</em>
                    <br>his first shot wounding the horse of the
                    <br>Neapolitan Captain, brought it on its haunches<span class="sic-corr"/>
                    <br>
         <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> siezed hold of the bridle, intending to
                    <br>
         <span class="sic-corr">to</span> secure the captain as his prisoner,
                    <br>but the captain answered to the demand to
                    <br>surrender by a blow with his sword at
                    <br>
         <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>, who <span class="supralinear">parried &amp;</span> retaliated, cutting the Neapolitan
                    <br>captain with one stroke down the face and
                    <br>neck and prostrating him dead at his feet<span class="sic-corr"/>
                    <br>While <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> was thus engaged in this

                    <br>managed to dispatch the other two.</p>

      </h5>
                    <p>At the Battle of <span class="place">Malazo</span> a body of troops called
                    <br>the English Batallion, commanded by <span class="person">Lieutenant
                    <br>Colonel Dunne</span> did <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> good service.
                    <br>When the Neapolitan troops were beaten off
                    <br>the field of battle into the town they made
                    <br>for the upper portion firing down the street
                    <br>as they retreated. The English Battalion
                    <br>followed them close to the fortress and got one
                    <br>of the most advanced posts. Throwing up a
                    <br>barricade at the top of the narrow thoroughfare,
                    <br>which leads immediately to the citadel, they
                    <br>maintained a hot fire against the Neapolitans
                    <br>until a stop was put to hostilities by the
                    <br>truce.</p>
                    <p>Although the whole movement was under
                    <br>the order more especially of <span class="person">Medici</span>, <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>
                    <br>was of course the soul of the fight, finding
                    <br>himself invariably at the point most exposed.
                    <br>He was with the centre, which was making
                    <br>its way slowly over and through all obstacles,
                    <br>when the news arrived, that the left, unable
                    <br>to resist the superior force of the enemy,
                    <br>was giving way

                    <br>and thus exposing the whole line to be turned
                    <br>on that side. Taking the only reserve remaining
                    <br>the so called English Battalion commanded by

         <span class="person">Lieutenant Colonel Dunne</span> and several other English

         <span class="add">to</span> stem the advance of
                    <br>the Neapolitans. The presence of <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>
                    <br>and the exertions of the English officers succeeded
                    <br>in steadying, who not only resisted further
                    <br>attacks but pushed forwards and captured the
                    <br>guns with which the enemy was sweeping
                    <br>the road. The English batallion is

                        <p>The capture of <span class="place">Reggio</span> was achieved in masterly
                        <br>style, the Garibaldian army attacking the town
                        <br>at different sides at once, so that the Neapolitan troops had their retreat cut off in all directions.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the first cannon shots had been

                        <br>ent<span class="sic-corr">e</span>rance of the Straits. It was indeed quick

                        <br>made a race to overtake the boats and all they

                        <br>empty boats while the troops they contained
                        <br>took up a position on the heights. In

                        <br>At half past four the Garibaldians were in the heart
                        <br>of the Royalist camp and found the troops completely
                        <br>panic stricken. The soldiers had thrown on the ground
                        <br>their arms and baggage, the cannon were
                        <br>abandoned and the officers stood with their swords
