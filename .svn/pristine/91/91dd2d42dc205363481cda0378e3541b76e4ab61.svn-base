						<p style="text-align:justify;padding-right:15px;">In this section we will collect student projects about the  Garibaldi panorama. During  spring semester 2011, and again in fall 2012, Prof. Riva taught an experimental seminar on the panorama in which a select group of graduate and undergraduate students used vision technology (the Microsoft Surface) and new software for collaborative learning and research (LADS/TAG and WorkTop) developed under the direction of Computer scientist Andy van Dam and with the assistance of Elli Mylonas of the library's Center for Digital Scholarship.  Using this software, students were able to collect digital documents directly from the Brown repository and the web and annotate them, producing a complete set of interlinked digital materials associated with the 54 scenes of the Garibaldi panorama [see slides?]. The first two projects featured in this section experimented with timelines and maps, in order to visualize chronological and compositional elements of the panorama's visual narrative.</p>
