                    <br>which elapsed from their departure, the
                    <br>report of some musket shots and a cannon had

                    <br>next day some news of the devoted band
                    <br>was hoped for, and the movements on the
                    <br>other side were watched for with great
                    <br>anxiety especially as some casual firing was
                    <br>observed. At noon the report arrived that
                    <br>the men had made good their retreat to the
                    <br>mountains and it was determined to draw the
