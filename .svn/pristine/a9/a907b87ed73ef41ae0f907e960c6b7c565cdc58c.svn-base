                        <p>Early on the <span class="date" data-when="1849-06-03">third of June (1849)</span> and while it was
                        <br>yet dark the French column glided towards the Villa
                        <br>Pamphili, dec<span class="sic-corr">ie</span>ving the sentinel with <span class="underline">Viva l'Italia</span>
                        <br>he suffered them to approach—and was poniarded.
                        <br>The column then rushed into the Villa—
                        <br>Pamphili—In  short time the Villas
                        <br>Corsini and Valentine were also taken. Now
                        <br>the Villa Corsini being taken was an enor­
                        <br>mous loss to <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>, for as long as he
                        <br>was master of that the french could not draw
                        <br>their par<span class="sic-corr">r</span>allels—at any price <em class="underline">that must</em>
                        <br>be <span class="supralinear">re</span>taken. It was only a terrible but
                        <br>victorious assault that could restore the

                        <p>
         <del>Therefore the multitude, on the very instant
                        <br>united themselves with the man who person­
                        <br>ified the wants of the moment—and who
                        <br>was the hope of all. Thus the <em class="underline">public need</em>
                        <br>restored to <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> his title of General which
                        <br>had been contested in his last campaign by
                        <br>the very people for whom he was fighting.</del>

                        <p>
         <span class="person">Ugo Bassi</span> and <span class="person">Gavazzi</span> his friend, were a providence
                        <br>to the army. His <span class="supralinear">(<span class="person">Ugo's</span>)</span> powerful eloquence not only
                        <br>raised the Italians to the love of <span class="place">Italy</span> and a devotion
                        <br>for her, but it drew from the most rebellious coffers
                        <br>numerous and rich offerings. At <span class="place">Bologna</span>
                        <br>the rich gave money by thousands: the women
                        <br>gave their jewels their ring<span class="sic-corr"/> and their ear-rings. One
                        <br>young girl having nothing to give him, cut off
                        <br>her <em class="underline">magnificent</em> hair, <em class="underline">and offered <span class="sic-corr"/> to him</em>.
                        <br>He was present at all the Battles, and all acts of
                        <br>devotedness, he acted as <span class="supralinear">a</span> sister of Charity, an
                        <br>apostle and was an intrepid soldier!</p>
                        <p>
         <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> thus speaks of his friend <span class="person">Ugo Bassi</span>—<blockquote>"His
                        <br>powerful word fascinated the people, and if
                        <br>God had marked a term to the misfortune of <span class="place">Italy</span>
                        <br>—the <em class="underline">Voice</em>, <span class="person">Bassi</span>, like that of <span class="person">St Bernard</span>, might
                        <br>have drawn whole populations to the field.</blockquote>
