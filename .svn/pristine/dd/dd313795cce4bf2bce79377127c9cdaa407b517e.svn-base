                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">During the Battle of <span class="place">Melazzo</span>, one advance
                    <br/>bolder than the rest brought them to the guns
                    <br/>
      <del>An English</del> sailor was the first across the wall
                    <br/>behind which the guns were posted, and the
                    <br/>next mom<span class="sic-corr">o</span>nt they were carried in triumph.
                    <br/>Just at that instant a cry arose of
                    <br/>
      <span class="quoted">Cavalry!—Cavalry!</span> and excited con­
                    <br/>fusion—vain were the attempts of
                    <br/>
      <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> and his officers to overcome
                    <br/>this bugbear of young troops, they
                    <br/>pressed against a garden wall on one
                    <br/>side, and jumping a ditch on the other,
                    <br/>they opened a road to about a dozen bold
                    <br/>horsemen who with their captain at
                    <br/>their head rushed through this break in
                    <br/>our line to recapture the guns.—<span class="person">Garibaldi</span>
                    <br/>had only time to pass aside when the
                    <br/>horsemen passed sabreing right and left.
                    <br/>But they did not go far, for after the
                    <br/>first panic, the infantry recovered and
                    <br/>soon emptied the greater part of their
                    <br/>saddles.</p>

                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Captain, a Sergeant, and a private tried to
                    <br/>make their escape, and would have succeeded
                    <br/>but for <span class="person">Garibaldi's</span> personal bravery, he went
                    <br/>into the middle of the road, having left his
                    <br/>revolvers in the holsters when he dismounted.
                    <br/>—he drew his sword and placed himself in
                    <br/>a position to stop the captain, the only
                    <br/>person with him at the time was <span class="person">Captain Missori</span>
                    <br/>who was also on foot, but armed with a <em class="underline">revolver</em>
                    <br/>his first shot wounding the horse of the
                    <br/>Neapolitan Captain, brought it on its haunches<span class="sic-corr"/>
                    <br/>
      <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> siezed hold of the bridle, intending to
                    <br/>
      <span class="sic-corr">to</span> secure the captain as his prisoner,
                    <br/>but the captain answered to the demand to
                    <br/>surrender by a blow with his sword at
                    <br/>
      <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>, who <span class="supralinear">parried &amp;</span> retaliated, cutting the Neapolitan
                    <br/>captain with one stroke down the face and
                    <br/>neck and prostrating him dead at his feet<span class="sic-corr"/>
                    <br/>While <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> was thus engaged in this
                    <br/>single handed combat, <span class="person">Captain Misori</span>
                    <br/>managed to dispatch the other two.</p>

                    <br/>a little to animate the troops<span class="sic-corr"/>
