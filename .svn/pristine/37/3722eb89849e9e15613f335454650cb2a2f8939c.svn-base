                        <p>At midnight, the heavens cleared, the thunder
                        <br>and the cannons ceased, and silence succeeded
                        <br>to the infernal combustion.</p>
                        <p>In the morning <em class="underline">three</em> reports of cannon, fired
                        <br>at equal distance of time was heard: this
                        <br>was the french signal for attack. The Sentinels
                        <br>cried to arms and trumpets sounded!
                        <br>The Bersaglieri always ready, always <em class="underline">indefatigable</em>
                        <br>hastened to the Gate of <span class="person">St. Pancrazio</span>.
                        <br>
         <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> placed himself at their head
                        <br>—sword in hand singing the popular hymn
                        <br>of <span class="place">Italy</span>.—<blockquote>"At that moment</blockquote>—(says <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>
                        <br>
         <blockquote>""so completely was I discouraged with regard
                        <br>to the future, that I had but one wish, and
                        <br>that was to be killed. I threw myself on the
                        <br>French of what took place I know nothing."</blockquote>
      </p>
                        <p>During an hour he continued to strike
                        <br>without ceasing.—When he came out
                        <br>of the fight he was <em class="underline">covered with blood</em>!

                        <br>As he was leading the fight he learned
                        <br>that his poor Negro servant had just been
                        <br>killed, he was holding ready an exchange

                        <br>through his head<span class="sic-corr"/>

                        <p>When <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> appeared at the door of the
                        <br>chamber all the deputies rose and applauded
                        <br>—he looked upon himself to see what
                        <br>awakened their enthusiasm—he was
                        <br>covered with blood—his clothes were
                        <br>pierced with balls and bayonet thrusts
                        <br>his sabre was so bent with striking
                        <br>that it was not more than half in
                        <br>its sheath—They cried—<span class="quoted">"to the Tribune
                        <br>—To the Tribune"</span> he mounted it and told
                        <br>them that all defence was impossible unless
                        <br>they wished to make <span class="place">Rome</span> another <span class="place">Sarragossa</span>
                        <br>—at that period audacity was repulsed,
                        <br>little means prevailed—he could not urge
                        <br>the argument further—had he been attended
