                    <p>In the view before us we have the bridge and

                        <br>is spanned by a handsome bridge in connection

                        <br>the dangers and ravages of the avalanches
                        <br>—The avalanch is seen in the act
                        <br>of falling and at once explains the nature
                        <br>of the gallery: the gallery is perforated
                        <br>at the side with small openings to let in
                        <br>the light. Looking out from these, the

                        <br>the roar of the water beneath with the
                        <br>thunder of the avalanch is appalling.
                        <br>The rocks rise on each side to a frightful

         <span class="add">ed</span> by a prolonged rolling

                        <br>detached and rolls down the declivities with
                        <br>headlong fury increasing in si<span class="sic-corr">s</span>e by the
                        <br>adherence of the snow with which it meets
                        <br>—It then precipitates itself with frightful
                        <br>violence into the lower districts, dragging
                        <br>with it large masses of rocks, overwhelming
                        <br>and destroying sometimes whole villages and

                    <br>in the clouds, whence it descends in such

                    <br>through which the road is conducted as

                    <p>We have entered now upon some of the wildest
                    <br>mountain scenery. This is the far famed pass
                    <br>of the <span class="place">Cardinells</span>. As you turn an angle
                    <br>in the <span class="sic-corr">R</span>oad and advance a few feet you
                    <br>suddenly find yawning before you, a fearfull

                    <br>stones come thundering down now and then with
                    <br>the terror of an avalanche.</p>
                    <p>You step carefully down the gallery or shelf
                    <br>till perhaps you are near <em class="underline">the centre</em> of the pass.
                    <br>—Now look up along the perpendicular

                    <br>edge, they look as if blanched with terror.
                    <br>—What a steep gigantic mountain brow
                    <br>they fringe! You feel in a perilous position
                    <br>as you step cautiously along the gallery, and
                    <br>yet you cannot resist going back and
                    <br>gazing again down into the measureless
                    <br>gulf, and enjoying again the sudden sweep
                    <br>of this sublime gorge upon the vision.</p>
                    <p>—On the <em class="underline">other side</em> of the gulf, overhung

                    <br>there seems to be something in motion along the smooth

                    <p>The Romans having the Austrians still some
