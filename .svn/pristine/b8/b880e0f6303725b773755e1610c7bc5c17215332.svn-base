                    <br/>described by one who visited the general. <blockquote>I was

                    <br/>door to welcome me which he did in such terms,
                    <br/>that I at once felt myself at ease.</blockquote>

                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The house is of very modest pretentions though
                    <br/>comfortably furnished. Many things belonging

                    <br/>attention to with a sadness so intense that I
                    <br/>felt the warm tears running down my cheeks<span class="sic-corr"/>
