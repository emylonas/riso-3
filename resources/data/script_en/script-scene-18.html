                    <br/>every house seemed to cast forth its inhabitants
                    <br/>—in an instant the streets were filled
                    <br/>with people.—<span class="person">Garibaldi</span> dreaded the
                    <br/>confusion such a multitude would throw into
                    <br/>the ranks—he insisted upon their waiting

                    <br/>turned upon the Bastions occupied by the

                    <br/>first to the assault: although thundered
                    <br/>upon by the french artillery, they rushed
                    <br/>with bayonet upon the grand guard &amp;
