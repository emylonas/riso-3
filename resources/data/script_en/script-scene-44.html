                        <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The capture of <span class="place">Reggio</span> was achieved in masterly
                        <br/>style, the Garibaldian army attacking the town
                        <br/>at different sides at once, so that the Neapolitan troops had their retreat cut off in all directions.</p>
                        <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Meanwhile the first cannon shots had been
                        <br/>the signal for a general crossing from the
                        <br/>Faro point, nin<span class="sic-corr"/>ty boats full of men made
                        <br/>a rush for the opposite coast escaping the
                        <br/>notice of the only Neapolitan steamer at the
                        <br/>ent<span class="sic-corr">e</span>rance of the Straits. It was indeed quick
                        <br/>work, such as the war steamers of <span class="place">Naples</span> are
                        <br/>not used to. <span class="sic-corr">b</span>oth the steamers from <span class="place">Reggio</span>
                        <br/>made a race to overtake the boats and all they
                        <br/>could do was to fire at the beach shattering the
                        <br/>empty boats while the troops they contained
                        <br/>took up a position on the heights. In
                        <br/>the meantime <span class="person">Bixio</span> had likewise entered
                        <br/>by the main street. At the Piazza of the
                        <br/>Duomo some obstinate fighting took
                        <br/>place. At the Bar<span class="sic-corr"/>icades to the
                        <br/>left of the church, the volunteers performed <span class="sic-corr"/>
                        <br/>remarkable deed of daring. They fought

                        <br/>like lions driving the Neapolitan soldiers before
                        <br/>them and taking many of them prisoners, while
                        <br/>the rest made their <span class="supralinear">retreat</span>
      <del>way toward <span class="place">San G<span class="gap">[gap of 3chars]</span>nni</span>
      </del>.</p>
                        <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The town was thus clear in less than two
                        <br/>hours from the time the first fire began.
                        <br/>At half past four the Garibaldians were in the heart
                        <br/>of the Royalist camp and found the troops completely
                        <br/>panic stricken. The soldiers had thrown on the ground
                        <br/>their arms and baggage, the cannon were
                        <br/>abandoned and the officers stood with their swords
                        <br/>in their scabbards. <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> advanced amongst
                        <br/>them, and silence was enjoined, he spoke in a loud voice, <span class="quoted">"Soldiers! you as well as my
                        <br/>companions are the sons of <span class="place">Italy</span>, remember
                        <br/>this you are at liberty, whoever wishes to remain
                        <br/>with us may enlist, whoever wishes to go home
                        <br/>may do so,"</span> after these words, all the Royal
                        <br/>soldiers began shouting <span class="quoted">Viva <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>! Viva
                        <br/>
         <span class="place">l'Italy</span>.</span> Then they rushed forwards and <em class="underline">kissed</em>
                        <br/>
      <span class="person">Garibaldi's</span> hands, arms and feet, they
                        <br/>thronged round him as if they would have
                        <br/>smothered him. They were absolutely mad
                        <br/>with delight.</p>
