                    <br/>few weeks—ten or twelve at most—<del>and</del> the

                    <br/>The only precaution, however, which they can
                    <br/>employ under these circumstances, is to remove
                    <br/>the bells from the mules' necks, and thus persue

                    <br/>even of a bell, or the sound of the human
                    <br/>voice, are sufficient to detatch those awful
                    <br/>masses, which with so much truth, have
                    <br/>been described as the thunderbolts of the <span class="place">Alps</span>.

                    <br/>fertile source of disaster to the traveller.
                        <br/>The <em>"Tourmente"</em> or <em>snow hurricane</em> is too
                    <br/>often a destructive phenomenon in the <span class="place">Alps</span>.

         <br/>In power and appearance, it may be com­
                    <br/>pared, not inaptly, to the sandy whirlwinds of
                    <br/>the desert, under which entire caravans

                    <br/>snow of the higher valleys is carried aloft
                    <br/>in the clouds, whence it descends in such
                    <br/>profusion along the deep and narrow defiles
                    <br/>through which the road is conducted as
                    <br/>completely to obliterate all traces of the path
                    <br/>and even bury the poles which serve as the
                    <br/>only safeguard in these inhospitable regions.</p>

                    <br/>intense and so increased by the momentum
                    <br/>with which the snowy particles are driven
                    <br/>along, that the skin becomes inflamed and
                    <br/>blistered—the joints wrung with excruciating
                    <br/>pains, and the eyes effected with partial or
                    <br/>entire blindness. In this dil<del>l</del>emma,
                    <br/>deprived of all succour, and the means of
                    <br/>proceeding with safety, the unhappy
                    <br/>traveller loses all presence of mind, resigns
                    <br/>himself to despair, and perishes where the
