      <del>When you are told that the summit of a
                        <br/>mountain, or part of the tract before you, is
                        <br/>full five leagues distant, incredulity may
                        <br/>be forgiven <em class="underline">when apparently</em> it <em class="underline">is not</em> more than
                        <br/>half that distance.—But set off: cross this
                        <br/>valley—twenty minutes you im<span class="sic-corr">m</span>agine will suffice
                        <br/>in twenty minutes you are only on the plank
                        <br/>spanning the stream, which from <em class="underline">your first</em>
                        <br/>view of it seemed but a small drain. You take
                        <br/>courage, and start afresh to reach the
                        <br/>Châlet at the <del>end of the valley</del> extremity of the <em class="underline">little</em>
                        <br/>plain forming the head of the valley—Say a
                        <br/>quarter of an hour's distance—in a quarter of an hour you find you have better than a quarter
                        <br/>of an hour's walk still before you, and at the
                        <br/>end of your walk you find what you conceived
                        <br/>to be a <em class="underline">single</em> Châlet proves to be a <em>cluster</em> of them
                        <br/>and what appeared to be small stones you discover to

                        <br/>after another seems to detatch itself, and become
                        <br/>an independent ridge, between which and the next
                        <br/>you have a valley to traverse:—and so on to the
                        <br/>very summit: concerning which you may have
