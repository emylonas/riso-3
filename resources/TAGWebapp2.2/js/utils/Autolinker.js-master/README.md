# Autolinker.js

Because I had so much trouble finding a good autolinking implementation out in the wild, I decided to roll my own. It 
seemed that everything I found out there was either an implementation that didn't cover every case, or was just limited 
in one way or another. 

So, this utility attempts to handle everything. It:

- Autolinks URLs, whether or not they start with the protocol (i.e. 'http://'). In other words, it will automatically link the 
  text "google.com", as well as "http://google.com".
- Will properly handle URLs with special characters
- Will properly handle URLs with query parameters or a named anchor (i.e. hash)
- Will autolink email addresses.
- Will autolink Twitter handles.
- Will properly handle HTML input. The utility will not change the `href` attribute inside anchor (&lt;a&gt;) tags (or any other 
  tag/attribute for that matter), and will not accidentally wrap the inner text of an anchor tag with a new one (which would cause 
  doubly-nested anchor tags).

Hope that this utility helps you as well!


## Installation

Simply clone or download the zip of the project, and link to either `dist/Autolinker.js` or `dist/Autolinker.min.js` with a script tag:

```html
<script src="path/to/Autolinker.min.js"></script>
```

Can also download via [Bower](http://bower.io):

```shell
bower install Autolinker.js --save
```

## Usage

```javascript
var linkedText = Autolinker.link( textToAutolink[, options] );
```
	
Example:

```javascript
var linkedText = Autolinker.link( "Check out google.com" );
// Produces: "Check out <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">google.com</a>"
```
	
### Options
There are options which may be specified for the linking. These are specified by providing an Object as the second parameter to `Autolinker.link()`. Options include:

- **newWindow** : Boolean<br />
  `true` to have the links should open in a new window when clicked, `false` otherwise. Defaults to `true`.
- **stripPrefix** : Boolean<br />
  `true` to have the 'http://' or 'https://' and/or the 'www.' stripped from the beginning of links, `false` otherwise. Defaults to `true`.
- **truncate** : Number<br />
  A number for how many characters long URLs/emails/twitter handles should be truncated to inside the text of a link. If the URL/email/twitter is over the number of characters, it will be truncated to this length by replacing the end of the string with a two period ellipsis ('..').
  Ex: a url like 'http://www.yahoo.com/some/long/path/to/a/file' truncated to 25 characters may look like this: 'yahoo.com/some/long/pat..'
- **urls** : Boolean<br />
  `true` to have URLs auto-linked, `false` to skip auto-linking of URLs. Defaults to `true`.
- **email** : Boolean<br />
  `true` to have email addresses auto-linked, `false` to skip auto-linking of email addresses. Defaults to `true`.
- **twitter** : Boolean<br />
  `true` to have Twitter handles auto-linked, `false` to skip auto-linking of Twitter handles. Defaults to `true`.

For example, if you wanted to disable links from opening in new windows, you could do:

```javascript
var linkedText = Autolinker.link( "Check out google.com", { newWindow: false } );
// Produces: "Check out <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>"
```

And if you wanted to truncate the length of URLs (while also not opening in a new window), you could do:

```javascript
var linkedText = Autolinker.link( "http://www.yahoo.com/some/long/path/to/a/file", { truncate: 25, newWindow: false } );
// Produces: "<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/some/long/path/to/a/file">yahoo.com/some/long/pat..</a>"
```

### More Examples
One could update an entire DOM element that has unlinked text to auto-link them as such:

```javascript
var myTextEl = document.getElementById( 'text' );
myTextEl.innerHTML = Autolinker.link( myTextEl.innerHTML );
```
