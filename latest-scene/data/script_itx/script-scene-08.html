                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We have now before us a view of the far famed
                        <br/>Devil's Bridge. The old bridge, of which
                        <br/>you see a portion remaining, was constructed as far
                        <br/>back as <span class="date" data-when="1118">eleven hundred and eighteen</span>. The span of the
                        <br/>arch in the new bridge is seventy five feet, and
                        <br/>its height from the surface of the water to the
                        <br/>keystone is about one hundred feet, but as the
                        <br/>arch spans a cataract almost vertical in its
                        <br/>descent the bridge thus acquires an elevation of two
                        <br/>hundred feet ad<span class="sic-corr"/>itional.</p>

      <del>The whole scene is full of savage grandeur.
                    <br/>What a contrast is <span class="sic-corr">is</span> here to the green <span class="supralinear">and</span>

                    <br/>Here the deafening roar of the surge, as it
                    <br/>struggles with the opposing rocks, and leaps
                    <br/>and foams and thunders forths its hoarse song
                    <br/>of triumph—the feeling of personal danger<span class="supplied">(,)</span>
                    <br/>the shaking of the low parapet where you stand,

                    <br/>along whose flank the sheeted vapour floats

                    <br/>gusts and currents of wind, caused by

                    <br/>centre—itself twenty-seven feet higher than
                    <br/>the old one—seems forgotten amid the awful
                    <br/>appendages by which it is enclosed: yet in
                    <br/>the solidity of its structure, boldness of design and
                    <br/>airy expanse of arch, we have seen nothing —

                    <br/>affords more striking evidence how the genius
