   <h5>Landing of the troops of<span xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" class="sic-corr"/> the coast

                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The return of the thirty two boats with the good
                    <br/>news that they had landed their men was
                    <br/>scarcely expected. The news was rec<span class="sic-corr">ie</span>ved
                    <br/>joyfully after the profound silence and suspense
                    <br/>which elapsed from their departure, the
                    <br/>report of some musket shots and a cannon had
                    <br/>filled the spectators with alarm for the brave
                    <br/>fellows who had gone over. It appears that
                    <br/>the gun had been fired from the fort <em class="underline">only
                    <br/>after</em> the men had landed unobserved.</p>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">All that night and during the morning of the
                    <br/>next day some news of the devoted band
                    <br/>was hoped for, and the movements on the
                    <br/>other side were watched for with great
                    <br/>anxiety especially as some casual firing was
                    <br/>observed. At noon the report arrived that
                    <br/>the men had made good their retreat to the
                    <br/>mountains and it was determined to draw the
                    <br/>attention of the Neapolitans on the sea.</p>
