                    <br/>crowded with men prepared at once to surround
                    <br/>the Garibaldians. <del>The latter however did not alter
                    <br/>their course;—forced to sail against a contrary

                    <br/>It was with great reluctance that the sailors
                    <br/>thus exposed to the vessels of war, obeyed orders.
                    <br/>—Still they did so,—and after a short tack, they
                    <br/>lost their presence of mind and came
                    <br/>within range. A furious cannonade
                    <br/>was begun, which caused them to lose
                    <br/>all courage and squander in all—
                    <br/>directions.
