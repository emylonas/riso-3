                    <br/>attached to him, after a short rest in a peasant's
                    <br/>cottage, changed their dress, entered a neigh­

                    <br/>of <span class="place">Ravenna</span>. But the unhappy <span class="person">Annita</span>,
                    <br/>had suffered too greatly from her rude trials
                    <br/>by land and sea, often wanting food and
                    <br/>sleep, and her powers of endurance were

                    <br/>to the cause of the people, had hitherto sustained
                    <br/>her, and rendered her almost insensible to pain
                    <br/>and the suffering inherent in her condition.

                    <br/>perspective of a wretched future for her husband
                    <br/>and children, had crushed her vigour—

                    <br/>there, they learned from some sailors that the
                    <br/>Austrians were close on their track and they
                    <br/>
      <span class="sic-corr"/> forced to retreat at full speed. Fortunately
                    <br/>a noble minded man, supplied a phaeton
                    <br/>with which the flight was continued during
                    <br/>several hours. <span class="inline">death has maintained an absolute
