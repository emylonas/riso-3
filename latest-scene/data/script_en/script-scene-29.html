      <span class="person">Urban</span> (the commander of the Austrians) stopped before
                    <br/>the gates of <span class="place">Varese</span> and sent the following
                    <br/>ultimatium to the municipality.</p>

                    <br/>a fine of three million Livres, on the following
                    <br/>conditions. The first million within an hour—
                    <br/>the second an hour after the first,—the third

                    <br/>of payment, he became furious, and ordered
                    <br/>the firing to commence. The barbarians
                    <br/>fired into the town 197 shells, destroying
                    <br/>and setting fire to houses and killing the
