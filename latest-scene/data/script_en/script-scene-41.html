      <del>Long before you come to the coast of
                    <br/>
         <span class="place">Melazzo</span>, you see an isolated rock resembling
                    <br/>somewhat that of <span class="place">Gibralter</span>. On it stands
                    <br/>the citadel of <span class="place">Melazzo</span> occupying an area of
                    <br/>half a square mile and falling off baldly on
                    <br/>all sides. At the foot of it, towards the
                    <br/>land side, lies the town. <span class="sic-corr">b</span>oth are con­
                    <br/>nected by a narrow strip of land with the
                    <br/>mainland.</del> The bend of the neck of land
                    <br/>forms one of the most commodious
                    <br/>harbours in <span class="place">Sicily</span>. This ground was the
                    <br/>theatre of the Battle of <span class="place">Malazzo</span>. The fight
                    <br/>lasted for  hours, in the heat of the
                    <br/>day. The Neapolitans mainly stood on the
                    <br/>defensive firing from behind <span class="gap">[gap of 1chars]</span>

                    <br/>the Sicilians losing heavily throughout.</p>

      <del>In order to dislodge the enemy, the company
                    <br/>of Genoese Rifles were sent into the thicket.
                    <br/>The canes were so close that it was only
                    <br/>with difficulty the men could pass.
                    <br/>The genoese were wild with rage, man
                    <br/>after man was falling and they could not
                    <br/>get a sight of the enemy who was a<span class="sic-corr">r</span>ound

      <del>A general cry arose to charge,—At last there
                    <br/>seemed a chance to get at the enemy, but as <del>usual</del>
                    <br/>usual he did not wait for the bayonet, and a
                    <br/>few well aimed shots was all the satisfaction
                    <br/>which the Genoese got.</del> On the road towards
                    <br/>the town the Neapolitans made a last effort
                    <br/>to hold out concealing themselves behind some
                    <br/>large boats drawn up on the beach, and helped
                    <br/>by their field artillery, as well as that from the
                    <br/>castle. This checked the Garibaldians for a time.
                    <br/>But a column passing through a garden to the
                    <br/>left and the arrival of a steam frig<span class="sic-corr">g</span>ate
                    <br/>soon changed their resolution. <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> who
                    <br/>saw her approaching got into a boat and went
                    <br/>on board where his presence animated all.
                    <br/>A few well aimed shots from the frig<span class="sic-corr">g</span>ate
                    <br/>and the voll<span class="sic-corr">ie</span>s from the advancing c<span class="sic-corr">all</span>umn
                    <br/>followed up with a bayonet attack broke
                    <br/>this last resist<span class="sic-corr">e</span>nce of the Neapolitans.
                    <br/>Routed and dismayed they fled in confusion
                    <br/>towards the town, leaving fifty guns <del>in the
                    <br/>hands of the victors</del> 139 horses and one
                    <br/>hundred thousand rounds of ammunition as the
                    <br/>fruits of the victory of <span class="place">Melazzo</span>.</p>
