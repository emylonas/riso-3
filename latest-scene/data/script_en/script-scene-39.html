                    <br/>of a waiter at a <span class="place">Naples</span> hotel</del> has been for
                    <br/>some time the real ruler of <span class="place">Sicily</span>, and under
                    <br/>his auspices a system of torture has been
                    <br/>perfected, which is the consum<span class="sic-corr"/>ation of
                    <br/>diabolical cruelty. Every commisary,
                    <br/>every gaoler, has his own method of apply­

      <span class="sic-corr">,</span> It is revolting to come to details
                    <br/>but they are unhappily exact and confirmed
                    <br/>by official authority. The famous <span class="person">Pontillo</span>
                    <br/>owes his reputation to the species of torture which
                    <br/>he applies, making the victim sit down

                    <br/>blades</del> under which is set a pan of
                    <br/>burning coals.—Another commissary
                    <br/>applies to the accused, little iron Hands

                    <br/>of his clothes and binding his head between his
                    <br/>legs and suspending him from a beam

                    <br/>eyes start from their sockets, some have
                    <br/>recourse to starvation, to blows to the
                    <br/>deprivation of breathable air, and light
                    <br/>others have been confined in dungeons
                    <br/>swarming with filth and had the
                    <br/>filthy refuse of sewers poured upon them
                    <br/>the dead have been left to rot among the
                    <br/>living and sickness has claimed more victims
                    <br/>than the refined cruelty of these incarnate
                    <br/>fiends. It is from a yoke like this that
                    <br/>
      <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> has delivered the people of
                    <br/>
      <span class="place">Sicily</span>. It is against a government
                    <br/>composed of such monsters of cruelty
                    <br/>that the Sicilians have been so bravely and
                    <br/>so successfully fighting.</p>
