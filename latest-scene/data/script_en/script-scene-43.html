   <h5>English Batallion at the foot of the

   </h5>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">At the Battle of <span class="place">Malazo</span> a body of troops called
                    <br/>the English Batallion, commanded by <span class="person">Lieutenant
                    <br/>Colonel Dunne</span> did <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> good service.
                    <br/>When the Neapolitan troops were beaten off
                    <br/>the field of battle into the town they made
                    <br/>for the upper portion firing down the street
                    <br/>as they retreated. The English Battalion
                    <br/>followed them close to the fortress and got one
                    <br/>of the most advanced posts. Throwing up a
                    <br/>barricade at the top of the narrow thoroughfare,
                    <br/>which leads immediately to the citadel, they
                    <br/>maintained a hot fire against the Neapolitans
                    <br/>until a stop was put to hostilities by the
                    <br/>truce.</p>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Although the whole movement was under
                    <br/>the order more especially of <span class="person">Medici</span>, <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>
                    <br/>was of course the soul of the fight, finding
                    <br/>himself invariably at the point most exposed.
                    <br/>He was with the centre, which was making
                    <br/>its way slowly over and through all obstacles,
                    <br/>when the news arrived, that the left, unable
                    <br/>to resist the superior force of the enemy,
                    <br/>was giving way

                    <br/>and thus exposing the whole line to be turned
                    <br/>on that side. Taking the only reserve remaining
                    <br/>the so called English Battalion commanded by
                    <br/>
      <span class="person">Lieutenant Colonel Dunne</span> and several other English
                    <br/>officers he went to the left <del>an</del>
      <span class="add">to</span> stem the advance of
                    <br/>the Neapolitans. The presence of <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>
                    <br/>and the exertions of the English officers succeeded
                    <br/>in steadying, who not only resisted further
                    <br/>attacks but pushed forwards and captured the
                    <br/>guns with which the enemy was sweeping
                    <br/>the road. The English batallion is
                    <br/>not composed as might be supposed from its
                    <br/>title solely English. <span class="person">Major Percy Windham</span>
