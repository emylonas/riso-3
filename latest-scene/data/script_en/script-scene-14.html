                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The finest buildings of <span class="place">Rome</span>are the curches of
                    <br/>which it contains three hundred and sixty four.
                    <br/>St Peters (shown in the view before us) is the largest
                    <br/>and most magnificent Ec<span class="sic-corr"/>lesiastical structure in
                    <br/>the world, and surpasses our own St Pauls
                    <br/>Cathedral both in d<span class="sic-corr">e</span>mentions and the elevation of its
                    <br/>dome—The walls of <span class="place">Rome</span> include a circuit
                    <br/>of fifteen miles, but the greater part of the space
                    <br/>they enclose is occupied by gardens, vinyards, and

                    <br/>objects of grandeur and magnificence modern <span class="place">Rome</span> is
                    <br/>far from being a fine city. The streets are generally
                    <br/>narrow and the houses crowded together, and the dirt
                    <br/>and filth which every where abound is a disgrace to
                    <br/>a civilized country, and is what few would expect
                    <br/>to meet with in the <span class="soCalled">Eternal"</span> city of <span class="place">Rome</span>—so long the mistress of
                    <br/>the world.</p>
