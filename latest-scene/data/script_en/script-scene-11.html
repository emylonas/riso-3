   <h5>Dangerous pass in the
                    <br xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"/>mountain (<span class="place">Cardinells</span>)</h5>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We have entered now upon some of the wildest
                    <br/>mountain scenery. This is the far famed pass
                    <br/>of the <span class="place">Cardinells</span>. As you turn an angle
                    <br/>in the <span class="sic-corr">R</span>oad and advance a few feet you
                    <br/>suddenly find yawning before you, a fearfull
                    <br/>gulph of some nine hundred feet deep, into
                    <br/>which the ridge on which you stand seems
                    <br/>beetling over, ready to fall with your own weight.</p>
                    
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The torrent which rolls at the bottom of this gulf
                    <br/>is almost to<span class="sic-corr"/> far down for <span class="sic-corr">for</span> you to see the
                    <br/>swift glance of its waters, or hear the roar,
                    <br/>—for even the thunder of the mighty cataract
                    <br/>of <span class="place">Ni<span class="sic-corr">
            <span class="infralinear">e</span>
         </span>a<span class="sic-corr">
            <span class="infralinear">v</span>
         </span>gara</span> would be well nigh buried in
                    <br/>its depths.</p>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">You stand fixed in silent awe and admiration
                    <br/>—Below you is that fearful gulf down
                    <br/>plunging in a sheet perpendicular of almost a
                    <br/>thousand feet, while above you is a tremen­
                    <br/>dous overhanging precipi<span class="sic-corr">e</span>ce of near an equal
                    <br/>height, <span class="sic-corr">a</span>down and across the face of which
                    <br/>runs, cut out, the zig zag path by which
                    <br/>you are to pass.—</p>
                    
                    <a href="#/scene/11/page/47/" data-pagenum="47" class="pageNum">

                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The whole strata of this perpendicular face of
                    <br/>the mountain seems loosened above, and
                    <br/>ready to bury you in their fall, and the loose
                    <br/>stones come thundering down now and then with
                    <br/>the terror of an avalanche.</p>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">You step carefully down the gallery or shelf
                    <br/>till perhaps you are near <em class="underline">the centre</em> of the pass.
                    <br/>—Now look up along the perpendicular
                    <br/>height above you and see those bare frozen
                    <br/>detached masses of rock that see<span class="sic-corr">n</span> bending over the
                    <br/>edge, they look as if blanched with terror.
                    <br/>—What a steep gigantic mountain brow
                    <br/>they fringe! You feel in a perilous position
                    <br/>as you step cautiously along the gallery, and
                    <br/>yet you cannot resist going back and
                    <br/>gazing again down into the measureless
                    <br/>gulf, and enjoying again the sudden sweep
                    <br/>of this sublime gorge upon the vision.</p>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">—On the <em class="underline">other side</em> of the gulf, overhung
                    <br/>in like manner, <del>by</del>
      <span class="add">with</span> a sheer perpendicular mountain
                    <br/>there seems to be something in motion along the smooth
                    <br/>face of the precipice.—You look again steadily, it
                    <br/>is actually a line of mules and travellers creeping
                    <br/>like flies along the face of a wall. And you find
                    <br/>there is a road there also, cut along this fearful gulf
                    <br/>—out of the solid rock.</p>
