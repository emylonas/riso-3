      <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> did not cease to urge the
                    <br/>cowardly fishermen to follow him. He
                    <br/>exhausted his efforts to make them obey,
                    <br/>he offered them in advance any payment
                    <br/>they might desire, but nothing could induce
                    <br/>them. In the meanwhile a longboat which
                    <br/>had started in persuit succeeded in cutting
                    <br/>of<span class="sic-corr"/> from the main body. Other boats
                    <br/>followed in persuit, and the violence of the
                    <br/>firing compelled them to seek safety in
                    <br/>flight. <span class="sic-corr">b</span>y skilful manoeuvering <span class="person">Garibaldi</span>

                    <br/>prompt surrender to the chances of a desperate
                    <br/>defence, having deprived the soldiers of all
