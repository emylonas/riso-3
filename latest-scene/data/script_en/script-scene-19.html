                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It is true the Romans were surprised, but not
                    <br/>yet conquered. <span class="person">Garibaldi</span> had laid as<span class="sic-corr">s</span>ide the
                    <br/>idea of an assault, but was not a bit the less
                    <br/>disposed to dispute the ground foot by foot.
                    <br/>—In the mean-time <span class="person">General Odinot</span>, to
                    <br/>show as he had said in one of his bulletins, in
                    <br/>what <del>respect</del> reverence he held the city of
                    <br/>monuments ordered <em class="underline">bombs to be launched</em> upon

                    <br/>Many fell upon the capitol, some upon the Quirinel
                    <br/>one fell upon the little temple that covers the
                    <br/>
      <span class="person">Hercules</span> of <span class="person">Canova</span>, but the cupola was fortunately
                    <br/>strong enough to repel it.—<span class="sic-corr">a</span>nother burst
                    <br/>in the Spada pal<span class="sic-corr">l</span>ace, and damaged the famous
                    <br/>fresco of the Aurora of <span class="person">Guido Reni</span>.</p>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The conduct of the Roman people during these days
                    <br/>of trial was worthy of ancient times; whilst
                    <br/>during the night, p<span class="sic-corr">e</span>rsued by showers of projectiles
                    <br/>which crushed in the roofs of their houses,
                    <br/>mothers flew from one place to another, pressing
                    <br/>their children to their breasts; whilst
                    <br/>the streets resounded with cries and lamentations
                    <br/>—not a <em class="underline">single voice spoke of surrender</em>!!</p>
                    <p xmlns:tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In the midst of all this, one jeering cry was
                    <br/>heard, when a ball or an obus brought down the
                    <br/>side of a house—<span class="quoted">"Another benediction from
                    <br/>the Pope"</span>—<em class="underline">All</em> the artillerymen
                        <br/>(observe ladies and gentlemen,) <em>"<span class="quoted">"all"</span> had been
                    <br/>killed at their guns"</em>—and the duty of
                    <br/>artillerymen was performed by soldiers of the line.
                    <br/>As long as <em class="underline">one</em> of the cannon remained
                    <br/>upon its carriage it <em class="underline">replied</em>.</p>

      <span class="place">Rome</span> like a winding sheet.—On that terrible
                    <br/>night the tempest of the heavens was mingled
                    <br/>with that of the earth. The thunder growled
                    <br/>responsively to the cannon, the lightening
                    <br/>crossed the fire of the bombs, thunderbolts
                    <br/>fell in two or three places, as if to render the

                    <br/>of <span class="person">St Peter</span> the two armies maintained
